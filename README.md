# Hafiz | Building AI tools & apps

I like shipping small, purposeful tools that make everyday tasks easier, then polishing them until they feel great to use. I come from a game dev background (Unity/C++), now focused on AI-assisted workflows, desktop apps, and translation tooling.

- 📍 Based in Singapore · Building AI-assisted tools and desktop apps
- 🔭 Lately: iterating on Translator Helper (Angular + FastAPI) and polishing my PySide6 Spending Dashboard
- 🎮 Game dev background (Unity/C++); these days I focus on AI-assisted tools and desktop apps

## Featured work
